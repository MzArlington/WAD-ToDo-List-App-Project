# WAD-ToDo-List-App-Project


## Instructions:

For this project, you will create a web-based todo list application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and either Flask or Express (Python or JS backend). Additionally, you can optionally use a SQL database to store your todo list data.



## Starter Code:

To start with, you will get the basic starter code for the front-end part of the application. The starter code contains an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file with some basic markup, styling, and functionality.



### Examples of successful execution:

You can find examples of successfully executed todo list applications online to get an idea of how to design and structure your application.


## Steps:

To begin, set up your backend. Create a new project folder and set up your Flask/Express application with a basic server and routes for your application. 
You can refer to the documentation of Flask or Express to learn more about creating a basic server and routes. 

Next, set up your database. Choose a database technology to store your todo list data. Set up the database and create a table to store your tasks. Use a database ORM such as SQLAlchemy (Python) or Mongoose (JS) to connect to the database and retrieve data.

After setting up your backend, build the frontend. Update the starter code's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to add the necessary markup, styling, and functionality to create a todo list application. 

Implement the CRUD functionality. Implement the functionality to add, edit, and delete tasks from your application. Use AJAX or a similar technology to send and receive data between the frontend and backend.

Test the application by running it on the server and making sure it works as expected. Use debugging tools to find and fix any syntax or logic errors in your code.


### Hints and tips:

Use modular design patterns for your JavaScript code to keep it organized and maintainable.

Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize to make your application more visually appealing and responsive.

Use a version control system like Git to keep track of your changes and collaborate with your peers.


### Resources To Get Started:

Flask documentation: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/

Express documentation: https://expressjs.com/

SQLAlchemy documentation: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/

## Goals:

Learn to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a functional todo list application.

Practice collaboration and communication by working on a project with your peers.

Practice debugging code that has syntax mistakes or logic errors.

Analyze user needs and design web pages to match.


## Assumptions and Constraints:

Learners have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Learners have completed the introductory course on Flask/Express and know how to set up a basic server and routes.

Learners have an understanding of basic database concepts and SQL (if they choose to use a SQL database).
